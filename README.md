## Introduction

**Code Context LLM** bridges the gap between your codebase and **Large Language Models (LLMs)**. Without proper context, LLMs might **hallucinate** file structures or offer irrelevant suggestions, impacting developer productivity and code quality.

By generating a comprehensive **Markdown** outline of your project's directory tree, this tool empowers developers to enhance **prompt engineering**, improve **AI-assisted code navigation**, and facilitate **code understanding for AI** models. Ensure AI interactions are accurate, relevant, and aligned with your project's architecture.

## Features

- üîí **Secure Content Redaction**: Automatically redacts sensitive information like API keys, passwords, and credentials, allowing safe sharing of project structures. [Learn more about our security measures](#security).
- üß† **LLM Context Generation**: Provides accurate project context for improved LLM prompts, enhancing AI responses.
- üìÇ **Respects `.gitignore`**: Excludes files and directories specified in your `.gitignore`, keeping your context clean.
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Interactive & Non-Interactive Modes**: Choose between user-friendly prompts or command-line options for flexibility.
- üéØ **Customizable Exclusions**: Specify additional files or directories to skip, tailoring the output to your needs.
- üìù **Markdown Output**: Produces a readable and structured Markdown file for easy sharing and documentation.

## Installation

### Quick Start with npx

Get started instantly without installing:

```bash
npx code-context-llm
```

### Global Installation

Install the package globally to use it anytime:

```bash
npm install -g code-context-llm
```

## Usage

### Interactive Mode

Run:

```bash
npx code-context-llm
```

You'll be guided through prompts to:

- Provide the project directory path.
- Specify additional directories or files to skip.
- Set the output Markdown file name.

### Non-Interactive Mode

Use command-line options for automation:

```bash
npx code-context-llm --project-path ./my-project --output-file MyProjectStructure.md --skip-dirs dist,build --skip-files .env
```

### Command-Line Options

- `-p, --project-path <path>`: Path to the project directory (default: `.`).
- `-o, --output-file <filename>`: Name of the output Markdown file (default: `ProjectStructure.md`).
- `--skip-dirs <dirs>`: Comma-separated list of directories to skip.
- `--skip-files <files>`: Comma-separated list of files to skip.
- `-h, --help`: Display help information.
- `-V, --version`: Display the version number.

## Use Cases

- **LLM Prompt Engineering**: Enhance code summaries and refactoring tasks by providing LLMs with accurate project context, potentially saving up to **50%** of development time.
- **Codebase Documentation**: Automatically generate a Markdown outline of your project's architecture, reducing documentation effort by **up to 70%**.
- **AI-Assisted Development**: Improve the accuracy of AI-powered code suggestions and bug detection by offering context about file relationships.
- **Team Collaboration**: Share project structures with team members to improve onboarding and facilitate code reviews.
- **Codebase Summarization**: Create summaries of large codebases for reviews or audits, helping you quickly understand unfamiliar projects.

## Example Output

Here's a snippet of the generated Markdown:

````markdown
# Project Structure for /path/to/your/project

- **src/**
  - **components/**
    - Header.js (1.2 KB)
      - Content preview:
        ```javascript
        import React from "react";
        // Header component
        const Header = () => {
          return <header>Welcome to My Project</header>;
        };
        export default Header;
        ```
    - Footer.js (800 bytes)
  - **utils/**
    - helpers.js (2.5 KB)
- **package.json** (1.1 KB)
  - Content preview:
    ```json
    {
      "name": "my-project",
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "dependencies": {
        "react": "^17.0.2"
      }
    }
    ```
````

This structured overview helps LLMs understand your project's architecture, improving code analysis and AI interactions.

## Security

Your project's security is our priority. **Code Context LLM** automatically redacts sensitive information such as API keys, passwords, credentials, and other secrets from code previews. We use pattern matching to identify and replace sensitive data with `[REDACTED]`. However, we strongly recommend that you **review the generated Markdown file yourself** to ensure that no sensitive information is included before sharing it.
